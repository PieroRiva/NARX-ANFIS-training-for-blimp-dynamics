# NARX-ANFIS-training-for-blimp-dynamics
This code creates simulation data from the 6DOF dynamic model of a blimp and trains a 4 input NARX model ANFIS for the X axis speed of the blimp.
This code contains the basic C++ algorithms for 6DOF blimp dynamics and type 1 ANFIS training. This is actually a C++ program but created under the CUDA language for comparison purposes.
